MEMORANDUM FOR  USAFA/CS34 

FROM:  CS-34 C/Squadron Commander 

SUBJECT:  Disciplinary and Reward Reference System for CS-34 

REFERENCES:  (a) AFCWI 36-3501 Cadet Standards and Duties 
                            (b) AFCWI 51-201 Administration of Cadet Discipline 

APPLICABILITY: Applies to all Cadets or exchange personnel assigned to CS-34. In general, the cadetÕs immediate Supervisor should issue (if element leader or above) or be present for the issuing of all disciplinary paperwork, as determined by the CS-34 First Sergeant, CS-34 AFCW SQ/CC, and permanent party (Sq/CC and AMTs). The cadet should receive signatures on their paperwork by all members of their squadron chain of command within 3 business days before delivering it to CS-34 PP. 
PURPOSE: To provide subordinate leaders with options and recommendations for appropriate disciplinary actions or rewards for given situations. Ultimately, authority to issue adverse administrative action lies with the issuing/awarding authority for the relevant paperwork. Higher levels of command reserve the right to withhold authority and bring issues up to their level in accordance with Article 37 of the UCMJ.
NOTE: Details in this MFR are recommendations to assist front line Supervisors and Commanders on implementing corrective discipline. The source document is the AFCWI 51-201 and should be referenced before issuing discipline. Any disciplinary issues that are not addressed in the AFCWI 51-201 should be brought to permanent party immediately. 
1.    AMI/SAMI POLICY:
AMI Policy:
1.1.    First Failure (Score <= 84%): 
1.1.1.    The cadet and their supervisor should have a discussion regarding the failure and infractions. The conversation should be documented via DAF Form 174. The cadet should be given a Form 10 with 1 confinement scheduled by the Squadron Superintendent (Squadron trash duty, CCQ shift in Service Dress, etc.).
1.2.    Second Failure: 
1.2.1.    The cadet should be given a Form 10 with 10 demerits, 2 confinements scheduled by the Squadron Superintendent (Squadron trash duty, CCQ shift in Service Dress, etc.), and 2 tours to be completed within 10 duty days. The cadetÕs passes should be closed if the 2 tours and 2 confinements are not completed within 10 duty days of the offense and should remain so until completion and a subsequent Form 10 should be issued to document the failure to complete.
1.3.    Third or Subsequent Failures: 
1.3.1.    The cadet should be given a Form 10 with 15 demerits, 4 tours, and 4 confinements scheduled by the Squadron Superintendent. Loss of pass privileges for 2 weeks for cadet at the third failure and should continue to go up the chain with additional failures. The cadet should meet a SCRB to determine if conduct and aptitude probation is necessary.
1.4.    For all AMI and SAMI Scores < 92%
1.4.1.    The CadetÕs Passes should be closed until a member of their chain of command looks over their room, ensures the discrepancies causing the low score are fixed, and notifies Permanent Party.
1.5      Note on Consistency

1.5.1    In cases when a singular punishment applies to more than one person, all people involved must necessarily receive the same punishment for that infraction. For example, if a room fails an AMI, all members of that room shall receive the same punishment, regardless of being in different flights.

SAMI Policy:
1.1.    First Failure (Score <= 84%): 
1.2.    The cadet should be given a Form 10 with 10 demerits, 2 confinements scheduled by the Squadron Superintendent (Squadron trash duty, CCQ shift in service dress, etc.), and 1 tour to be completed within 10 duty days.
1.3.    Second Failure: 
1.3.1.    The cadet should be given a Form 10 with 15 demerits, 3 tours, and 3 
confinements. 

1.3.2.    Loss of pass privileges for 2 weeks for cadet at the third failure and should continue to go up the chain with additional failures.
1.3.3.    The cadet should meet a SCRB to determine if conduct and aptitude probation is necessary. 
2.    POSITIVE DI/OVER THE FENCE (OTF): 
2.1.    OTF: 
2.1.1.    Disciplinary action for an incident of willful neglect for the pass system in which a cadet leaves the USAFA installation under the following circumstances should be the immediate issuance of a CAT 3 Form 10 and placement on Conduct/Aptitude Probation under Permanent Party discretion. 
2.1.1.1.    Restriction under Permanent Party Discretion.
2.2.    Positive for DI and Unaccounted For: 
2.2.1.    Disciplinary action for cadet that accidentally forgets to sign out on any type of pass in FalconNet and cannot be reached by CS34 SDO, Permanent Party, etc. before TAPS should be a CAT 2 Form 10 with 2 confinements. This should decrease to 1 confinement if the cadet is accounted for prior to TAPS but poor planning leads to returning to USAFA after TAPS when expected to return prior.
