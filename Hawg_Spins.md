Chapter 1 – PURPOSE AND GUIDANCE
1.1 Intent. The Hawg Special Instructions (HAWG SPINS) are our local policies and      procedures directed by the Commander, Academy Military Trainers (AMTs), and the Hawg Cadet Leadership. As future officers in the United States Air Force, Space Force, or other services, it is imperative you learn to follow guidance that updates on a routine or as needed basis. Thus, an updated version of the HAWG SPINS will be updated each Academic Year (AY) semester or when needed changes are routed through the chain of command.
1.1.1. Guidance. The guidance in the HAWG SPINS contains all locally adapted policies and procedures. Any information not contained in this policy letter is in accordance with standing publications. If these instructions conflict, existing publications take precedence and a change to the HAWG SPINS should immediately be requested. All members of CS-34 are responsible for adhering to these policies and will hand sign a HAWG SPINS Form 1 at the CCQ desk within 3 duty days any time an update is published. Signing the Form 1 is acknowledgement that you read, understand, and will follow the HAWG SPINS. Cadets away for semester abroad, TDY, SCA, or other reasons will sign the most recent SPINS Form 1 within 3 duty days upon return during the AY.












Chapter 2 – PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS
2.1. Customs and Courtesies. All CS34 cadets are expected to abide by basic military customs and courtesies. Per AFCWI 36-3501 Cadet Standards and Duties, “Military customs and courtesies are proven traditions that explain what should and should not be done in many situations. They are an extension of cultural norms that form the foundation for our society.” 
2.1.1. Calling Squadron to Attention. Call the squadron to attention for the Commander when arriving for the first time in the morning or leaving for the last time that day. If a more senior officer enters the squadron AOR call the area to attention. If unsure, it is appropriate to ask, “Sir, are you arriving/leaving for the day?” If in doubt, call the squadron to attention. The first cadet to notice the Commander arrival/departure should call the squadron to attention. Additionally, the first cadet to see an officer arriving or departing that is higher ranking than the Commander should call the squadron to attention. When calling the squadron to attention it shall be done with Hawg Pride as: “HAWGS, ATTENTION!”
2.1.2. Reporting into COMMANDER or AMT Office. Fourth-class Cadets will formally report into the Commander office. When reporting into an AMT, fourth-class cadets will use standard reporting in procedures without a salute. Upperclassmen will only report in with formal procedures when seeing the Commander/AMT for an official reason (discipline, squadron interviews, etc.). Otherwise, knocking and asking, “Sir/Ma’am, do you have a moment?” is a completely acceptable practice.
2.2. Professional Relationships. In accordance with AFCWI 36-3501, cadets and permanent party will maintain professional relationships which includes social media. More information regarding professional relationships can be found in AFI 36-2909, Air Force Professional Relationships and Conduct. 
2.2.1 Relationships and Conduct Policy. Relationships are unprofessional, whether pursued on or off-duty, when they detract from the authority of superiors or result in, or reasonably create the appearance of, favoritism, misuse of office or position, or the abandonment of organizational goals for personal interests. In any combination, unprofessional relationships can exist between officers, enlisted members, cadets, civilian employees, or contractor personnel. Reference AFI 36-2909, USAFA Sup_1, Air Force Professional and Relationships. Unprofessional relationships are prohibited and punishable under Article 92 and Article 134, UCMJ.
2.2.2. Open Door Conversations. Any closed door one on one conversations that take place between a cadet and those who serve in a Special Function Liaison role (Integrated Prevention and Response, Character and Honor, Spiritual, PEERs, Equal Opportunity etc.) must be communicated to the Sq/CC, AMT(s) and Commander before it takes place or ASAP if extenuating circumstances present themselves.  Deviation from the Commandant’s Dormitory Door Policy is strictly prohibited, and the expectation of professionalism will stand in any setting. 
2.2.3 Dating and Close Friendships. Dating, courtship, and close friendships are subject to the same policy considerations as other relationships. Members must recognize that these relationships can adversely affect morale and discipline, even when the members are not in the same chain of command or unit. Forming such relationships between superiors and subordinates within the same chain of command or supervision is prohibited because such relationships invariably raise the perception of favoritism or misuse of position and erode morale, discipline, and unit cohesion. Should a prior personal relationship exist or evolve within the chain of command, the cadets involved will seek resolution through the cadet and PP chains of command (e.g., Air Force Cadet Wing Group Commander (Cadet Gp/CC) may not date Cadet Sq/CC within the same group or a member of the same group’s staff).

Chapter 3 – ADMINISTRATION
3.1. Commander Bed Rest Policy. The Commander has the authority to approve bedrest (on a case-by-case basis) which authorizes a cadet to miss classes and/or military duties. 
    3.1.1. Requesting Bed Rest. To request bed rest, cadets must send an email to the COMMANDER and both AMTs with the request and justification. Text body must state the nature of requesting bed rest and a list of military duties that will be missed. (ex. I am requesting bed rest because I have a stomach bug. Today I will miss M2, M4, and M6 classes as well as military training/IC practice, etc.). 
    3.1.2. Making Appointments. If bedrest is approved, the cadet must make a same-day 	appointment with the cadet clinic (medical related) or a same-day appointment with the 	Chaplain, MFLC, PPC or Mental Health (mental health related). 
    3.1.3. Notifying Instructors. The cadet must email their instructors and/or coach to notify them that they will be missing class/practice and copy the COMMANDER if requested by the instructor.
 3.1.4. Form 18 and AF Form 469. If a cadet is placed on a Form 18 or AF Form 469 by the medical clinic, the cadet will send a Teams message to the COMMANDER and AMTs. This message will include a picture of your Form 18. 

3.2. Weekday Overnight Policy. IAW AFCWI 36-3501: Table 3.1 Non-Chargeable Cadet Sign Out Periods states that weekday overnight passes can be granted through the discretion of the squadron COMMANDER/AMTs.
    3.2.1. C1C Passes. 1st Class Cadets (C1C) can request a weekend overnight pass with approval from CS-34 PP as long as they are a cadet in good standing (no probation).   
    3.2.2. Offenses. After executing an overnight pass, in the event a cadet is absent, tardy, 	or fails to meet dress and appearance standards outlined in the AFCWI 36-3501 without 	proper excusal and coordination, the cadet at fault will be administered a Form 10:  
i.	First Offense: loss of weekday passes for 30 days.

3.2.3. Probation Passes. In reference to AFCWI 36-3501 Cadet Standards & Duties (CS&D) Section 5.3, the pass is a privilege for cadets in good standing. Cadets on probation may forward a special pass request to the Commandant for approval, delegable no lower than PP SQ/CC. Cadets on probation may seek permission use a non-chargeable SAP pass, not to exceed one per week, to attend worship events during the duty week (such as SPIRE or other faith-group specific religious education programs) on a case-by-case basis through their squadron chain of command. This applies for cadets on Honor, Conduct, or Aptitude probations, PP will only grant passes for significant events.

3.2.4. Any cadet placed on the Commandant’s List, Dean’s List, and/or Athletic Directors List will earn one extra pass per list per month.

3.3. Cadet Travel Requests. Cadets requesting to travel outside the local area and/or miss mandatory duties require COMMANDER approval. 
3.3.1. Electronic Staff Summary Sheet (eSSS). A properly routed eSSS will be written and must have all attachments included as described in the “eSSS Instructions pptx.” In the “Form Templates, Examples, and Instructions” folder of CS-34 Teams. Leave requests should include Flt CC, Sq COS, Sq CC, AMT and COMMANDER for final approval. The cadet will submit the eSSS to their respective Element Leader who will route through: Flt CC  → Squadron Commander → AMT → COMMANDER. 

3.3.2.  SCA Requests. If the requested travel will force the cadet to miss mandatory duties (i.e. class, military training, mandatory formation, etc.) then an SCA is required in addition to the eSSS. The cadet must complete the SCA request in COMPASS and submit NLT 14 days prior to the planned departure. The COMMANDER will concur/not on the request, but the final approval rests with the SCA committee.

Foreign Clearance Guide. Travel to countries where the State Department has issued a Level III or Level IV travel warning, must be approved by Permanent Party Group Commander. All other OCONUS travel can be approved by COMMANDER. To request OCONUS travel, the cadet will fill out an eSSS along with all required documents, training, and coordination (as indicated by Cadet Foreign Clearance Guide). OCONUS travel requests are typically submitted NLT 30 days prior to requested departure.

3.3.4. Emergency Leave. In the event of an emergency, where short-notice travel is required, cadets should immediately contact AMTs and COMMANDER. Permanent Party will make every effort to expedite travel. 

3.4. Cadet Area Escort. The COMMANDER has the authority to approve cadets to escort individuals into the Cadet Area. To request approval to escort, the cadet will fill out an eSSS and submit it to the SEL. The SEL will route through the Sq/CC, AMT, and COMMANDER. Service dress will be worn when escorting individuals IAW USAFAI 36-2016, Cadet Escort Program.

It is essential and expected that cadets in CS-34 are aware of their chain-of-command and utilize it professionally and proficiently. A cadet’s corresponding chain-of-command will be outlined before the start of each semester and disseminated to CS-34 cadets by the Squadron’s Senior Enlisted Leader. 
4.3.1. Supervisor Expectations. Supervisors have the job to train and motivate their subordinates first and foremost. It is their responsibility to guide, train, and develop those they supervise through coaching and mentoring. It is important to meet with your subordinate often, at least spending dedicated time together once a month. Feedback and frequent meetings allow you to develop reasonable goals and track progress. It is expected that formal feedback is completed regularly and on time and that supervisors make efforts to support and develop their subordinates at a personal level.



 
Chapter 5 – DORM MANAGEMENT
5.1. Area of Responsibility (AOR). The CS-34 AOR is the eastern and southernmost hallways of the sixth floor of Sijan Tower. Our Squadron AOR is a physical representation of who we are as Hawgs. Anyone who sets foot in any room of our Squadron AOR must be met with an appearance and exhibition of exceptional Hawg Pride. 
5.1.1. General Cleanliness. All cadets of CS-34 will be stewards of our AOR and will contribute to the betterment of the safety, health, wellness, and appearance of the Squadron. The responsibility of cleanliness falls upon all members of CS-34. AOR cleaning details will be assigned to flights in a rotating order to ensure areas are kept in order. If AORs are left disorganized and dirty the flight responsible for the area will have passes closed until the area is cleaned.
5.1.2. Storage Rooms. CS-34 Storage Rooms should be kept orderly and follow all safety regulations. The lockers should be reserved only by cadets currently assigned to CS-34. 
5.1.2.1 One cadet from Force Protection will be responsible for ensuring compliance with the following guidelines by performing weekly checks and signing off on the cleaning log: 1.) Each locker must be clearly labeled with name, squadron, class year, and phone number using Hawg Locker Signs and affixed securely to the locker door. 2.) Each locker must be locked with a lock (no zip ties unless the locker is unclaimed). If the same cadet has claimed both the top and bottom halves of the locker, both must be locked. 3.) No items will be placed on top of the locker structure, nor in the hallways, including dollies. 4.) Floors will always be reasonably free from debris. 
5.1.2.2 Storage lockers on the 6th floor are reserved for C1Cs primarily. Each C1C is allowed one large storage locker on the 6th floor. Once all C1Cs have a 6th floor storage locker, any extras will be offered to C2Cs.
5.1.2.3 Any discrepancies will be remedied within 24 hours of the Force Protection cadet signing the cleaning log and annotated accordingly in the comments.
5.1.3. Squadron Activities Room (SAR). Each member of CS-34 will serve as a steward of the SAR; thus, upkeep of this room will be a shared responsibility and daily expectation.
5.1.3.1 The Trash CIC will ensure that trash is removed from the SAR   biweekly, and a new bag is replaced in the can. One warning will be issued involving overflowing trash. If the issue persists, the can will be taken away in the common areas.
5.1.3.2 All food/drinks placed in the microwave must be covered to avoid spills. If accidental spills occur, cadets will remove the glass turntable plate and clean it before leaving the SAR. 
5.1.3.3 The popcorn machine and other cooking appliances will be cleaned immediately after use, leaving no food debris to attract critters.
5.1.4. Academic Room. The list of all current cadet tutors in CS-34 are printed and posted in the squadron academic room. Reach out to anyone listed on the tutor sheet via a Teams message to receive help in the respective subject that one needs extra tutoring in.

Cadets are welcome to add or remove books but must always maintain neatness and orderliness. Please return all books after you are done with it. Only books will be stored in the library; any other miscellaneous school supplies will be stored in the valet or white caddy. Only USAFA yearbooks may be used for ruck weights.

5.1.5. Cadet in Charge of Quarters (CCQ). The CCQ is responsible for monitoring the squadron areas and ensuring all unusual activity is reported to the appropriate personnel. The CCQ will also help the SDO with reporting accountability if help is requested by the SDO. The CCQ with the last shift of the night is responsible for making sure that CQ is clean and orderly before leaving. CQ should be presentable for the next day. If a CQ shift is missed without adequate reasoning, the cadet who missed their shift will have their passes closed for 1 week and do a make-up shift assigned by the Squadron Superintendent. If the person after you does not show up, you are responsible for finding them and sitting the shift until they show up. Report this to the Staff Superintendent: if over 10 minutes late, the cadet will make up an additional shift.
5.1.5.1. Confinements. If assigned to sit a confinement, the shift will be scheduled by the Squadron Superintendent. Confinements will be served in service dress.
5.2. Work Order Requests. If you have a dorm facility issue that requires immediate attention, call 719-333-2790. If you have any type of dorm issue that does not require immediate attention (i.e. leaking sink/clogged sink/missing screen/broken desk, etc.) send an email to “Jobs at Sijan”. Within the email subject line include “CS34/ Room Number- description of the issue” and CC all members of PP and A4 Division Chief. Additionally, attached below is an example of an email sent recently. 


 
Chapter 6 – ACCOUNTABILITY
6.1. Senior Duty Officer (SDO). The Sq/COS is responsible for scheduling the SDO and is the OPR for all issues, concerns and conflicts regarding SDO responsibilities. The SDO is charged with ensuring accountability for all squadron members post duty and will be responsible for reporting issues to the Sq/SOC, Sq/CC and COMMANDER as they occur. 
6.1.1. FalconNet 2.0.  SDO will be assigned by the Sq/CC or Sq/COS to perform squadron accountability through FalconNet 2.0 capabilities. Pass limitations will be updated IAW changes from the Commandant effective 28 October 2024. Cadets will be accounted for through a paper Form 1 and FalconNet 2.0 effective 28 October 2024. Squadron administrative staff will assign squadron members to unit CS-34 to perform accountability, monitor cadet’s locations for safety purposes or adjust pass restrictions. Cadets that will not be staying on base during weekends or taking overnights will adequately sign out on overnight or weekend passes with essential information such as a proper address and date/time of return. 
6.1.2. Form 1, Dorm Inspection (DI).
6.1.2.1. Paper Form 1. If a paper Form 1 is required to take accountability of the squadron, the SDO will in C1Cs room at 2000 for all squadron members to sign to denote presence in the squadron. Eyes on accountability will be taken starting one hour before Taps and will continue until Taps or until all squadron members are accounted for and verified that they are in their place of domicile. 
6.1.3. Recalls. The Sq/CC, Sq/COS and Sq/SEL are responsible for ensuring accountability of the squadron during Wing/Group/Squadron recalls in the event of training exercises or times of crisis. Element Leaders will assume responsibility of their elements and conduct accountability via Eyes-On, Teams, or by Phone to ensure knowledge of location, activity and to ensure safety. A-Staff reports to their division chiefs for accountability. Final accountability will be submitted to corresponding Flight Commanders and the SEL who will then report results to the Sq/CC. A minimum of two training recalls will be executed throughout the duration of the semester.
6.2. Formation Accountability. Accountability will be taken at the beginning of mandatory formations including Morning Accountability Formation (MAF) and Noon Meal Formation (NMF). Accountability will also be taken during mandatory squad or class wide events including football games, wing wide training, and other events where required. During formations, accountability will be taken by Element Leaders, Flight Chiefs, Flight Commanders or Command Staff via FalconNet 2.0. For football games, wing wide training, and other events accountability will be taken via a physical Form 1 that the Senior Enlisted Leader (SEL), First Sergeant, or Staff Superintendent will oversee tracking. 
6.3 Unexcused Absences. Cadets missing classes/PFT/AFT that are unexcused will open the doors to a suspended disenrollment from the Commandant. PP will receive a roster of unexcused absences and administrative actions will result from these circumstances.
6.4 Cadet Parking Violations. Cadet parking violations are adjudicated at the wing level currently and will result in serious punishment and possible meetings with the Commandant.
6.5. Basic Dignity and Respect. Everyone in CS-34 and the Cadet Wing is a human being with unique perspectives and a natural right to dignity and respect. It is essential that we have the utmost respect and admiration for each other here in CS-34 to achieve a cohesive family environment. Hazing, discrimination, or bullying will not be tolerated in CS-34. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in immediate Squadron Commander review. 
6.6. Personal Accountability and Discipline. Personal accountability is a fundamental attribute of officer-ship and requires that you be in the right place at the right time in the right uniform. The requirements of peer and supervisor discipline come from a foundation of holding ourselves accountable. The discipline tracker will be kept by the squadron cadet First Sergeant. The First Sergeant will track all discipline within the squadron and will coordinate with the AMTs to ensure that it gets filed appropriately within the cadet’s record. Additionally, the First Sergeant will ensure that the upper three classes are educated on the process below and that templates of all required forms are posted to facilitate standardization. Cadet leaders, at all levels, are responsible for enforcing standards and administering discipline of their assigned personnel IAW task organization. When feasible, discipline should be administered at the lowest possible level (i.e. front-line supervisor) and with an appropriate amount of grace. Paperwork will be tracked and processed through the CS-34 “Paperwork Tracker”. 
6.6.1. Methods of Counseling. 
6.6.1.1. Form 174. This form is used to document that counselling has occurred. It is typically recommended for minor, first time infractions. The form will be documented by the person giving the counselling (direct supervisor) and tracked by the Squadron First Sergeant.
6.6.1.2. Form 10. This form is used to document the implementation of the Cadet Disciplinary System. Cadet supervisors may issue demerits, confinements, tours, loss of pass privileges, CQ shifts, etc. Recommended for more significant or repeat offenses. The form will be written by the direct supervisor and tracked by the Squadron First Sergeant. In the event the receiving cadet is in command staff or does not have a direct supervisor, the Squadron First Sergeant will take responsibility for writing and submitting the paperwork and discipline. The punishment attached to a Form 10 will be in accordance with Group 4 guidance.
6.6.1.3. LOC/LOA/LOR. This letter can be issued by itself or can accompany a Form 10. Per AFCWI51-201 “Administration of Cadet Discipline”, LOCs and LOAs may be written by cadet commanders and supervisors. LORs can only be issued by a COMMANDER. These letters are an indication of a final attempt from cadet leadership to correct behavior before a SCRB and/or Permanent Party involvement is required. The Squadron First Sergeant will track it as well as Permanent Party to see if additional action is needed.
6.6.1.4. Squadron Commander Review Board (SCRB). The Squadron Commander has the authority to convene a SCRB to review cadet performance, take disciplinary action, and/or make recommendations to the COMMANDER to place a cadet on conduct/aptitude probation. 

Chapter 7 – OPERATIONS
7.1. Weekly Schedule. The squadron Staff Superintendent will communicate the weekly schedule with the squadron every Sunday by 1600. The Staff Superintendent is responsible for knowing any updates to the schedule throughout the week and communicating them with the squadron.
Chapter 8 – Training 
8.1. Semester Training Plan. The Squadron will adhere to the semester training plan provided by Group and Wing training. Training will take place in the morning Pre Flight period. Current Events staff will be responsible for leading the training or providing the appropriate resources for flights to perform the training correctly

8.2. Planning and Coordination. For any kind of physical activity training, an OPORD must be written and submitted for COMMANDER approval at a minimum of 48 hours before the event occurs. For any event that is not a physical activity a OPORD is NOT required but must be approved by the Squadron Commander. The Squadron Commander must be given the plan at a minimum of 48 hours. 
8.2.1.  Major Assessment and Events. For any Major Events, Wing will send out an OPORD and this must be shared within Sq/TO, Sq/MAEO, Sq/CC, Sq/COS and A3 Commander. MAE will be the lead for any Major Event and will produce the brief, plan, and de-brief but will share all information with those mentioned above. 
8.3. Execution. All Military Training will be executed IAW approved OPORDs. Any deviation from approved OPORDs must be cleared by POCs or signatories of said OPORD. If a cadet permits a deviation, said deviation must be made IAW previously identified Commander’s Intent. Standard deviations should be constrained to extenuating circumstances, such as inclement weather and the “Knock It Off” policy.

 
Chapter 9 – STANDARDIZATION AND EVALUATION
9.1. MFR Guidance.
